cbpsc is beta software. I (Tom Stoll) have been testing it and fixing bugs for several months and am working towards a 1.0 release in early 2012. That said, you may encounter bugs and/or undocumented features.

cbpsc has been tested for SC 3.4.4 "with-extras" on a MacBook Pro (first generation Core Duo), and should work on any recent Mac. It uses two quarks that are not in the included classes, "KDTree" and "TabbedView".

To install:

  1. Unzip the archive or clone the Git repo.
  2. Drag the 4 .sc files to your Extensions folder (~/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions or /Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions).
  3. Recompile sclang (apple-K).

To Install KDTree and TabbedView:

  1. Evaluate "Quarks.gui".
  2. When the window appears, select "KDTree" and "TabbedView". Their buttons should turn blue and change from "-" to "+".
  3. Click the "Save" button at the top right.
  4. Don't forget to recompile the library (apple-K).

To Run the GUI: open "gui.rtf" and follow the directions in the numbered comments. See http://crprsnrs.corpora-sonorus.com/text/cbpsc/1-getting-started for more detailed instructions. Read below for some known issues.

A growing amount of documentation can be found at http://www.corpora-sonorus.com.


KNOWN ISSUES (as of version 0.5 -- October 2011)

These are a few things you might encounter. They will all hopefully be fixed as soon as possible.

1. Watch the Server GUI when importing large amounts of audio data. It may turn itself 'inactive' at times when under a heavy computational load. You must wait a few seconds until the Server is active to continue using the GUI without errors.

TEST SOUND SET

Download and use the following sound files to test the GUI: http://www.freesound.org/packsViewSingle.php?id=2680
Or, alternatively, find them in the GIT repo as a zip file. These files are known to work with CBPSC.
