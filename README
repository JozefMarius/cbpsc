KNOWN ISSUES (as of 10.15.10)

These are a few things you might encounter. They will all hopefully be fixed as soon as possible.

1. Watch the Server GUI when importing large amounts of audio data. It may turn itself 'inactive' at times when under a heavy computational load. You must wait a few seconds until the Server is active to continue using the GUI without errors.

2. Import/export is still buggy. This will be polished in version 0.1.2.
